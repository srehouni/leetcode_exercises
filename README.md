# Leetcode problems

I wanted to pick up the habit of solving Leetcode's problems. I think they are quite good, and I don't often face this kind of problems on my dalily basis. 
The language I've picked up to develop this algorithms has been Golang. I'm still learning this language so it will be a double win. 
I'll be following TDD to solve them, so every problem will have its tests.

## Problems 
- [x] 1. Two Sum
- [x] 2. Add Two Numbers
- [x] 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- [x] 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays
- [x] 5. Longest Palindromic Substring
